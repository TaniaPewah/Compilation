1. copy your .h/.hpp/.cpp parser.ypp scanner.lex files into src folder.
2. run python script "python files_to_submittion.py" on csComp, make sure your in the right directory.
3. if a test fails then the program will output all you need to know, if not you can do your own testing in 
src and the script can handle it.
4. if all tests pass you can find the submission zip file in the folder "submission_folder" that will be created.

notes:
2 tests have been added since 6/27/2020
